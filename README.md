# Dino AR Explorer ðŸ¦•

A web-based Augmented Reality application for children to discover dinosaurs by drawing them! This app uses computer vision to detect dinosaur drawings and displays 3D dinosaur models in AR.

## Features

- ðŸ“± **Mobile & Tablet Optimized**: Works on smartphones and tablets
- ðŸŽ¨ **Drawing Detection**: Captures and analyzes children's dinosaur drawings
- ðŸ¦• **Dinosaur Recognition**: Identifies 6 different dinosaur types
- ðŸ¥½ **AR Experience**: Displays 3D dinosaur models in augmented reality
- ðŸ“š **Educational Content**: Shows dinosaur information and characteristics
- ðŸŽ® **Interactive Controls**: Touch controls to move and rotate dinosaurs

## Supported Dinosaurs

1. **Triceratops** - Three-horned herbivore
2. **Tyrannosaurus Rex** - The king of dinosaurs
3. **Stegosaurus** - Plated dinosaur with tail spikes
4. **Brontosaurus** - Long-necked giant
5. **Pterodactyl** - Flying reptile
6. **Velociraptor** - Fast and intelligent predator

## How to Use
